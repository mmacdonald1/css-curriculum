# Welcome to CSS!
This is the curriculum I wrote for a custom css lecture I taught at Flatiron School. CSS and the endless rabbit hole of styling. 
Also use my [Style guide](https://github.com/mmacdonald1/Style-guide) where I summed up some visual design principles!

## Activities
* Css-fundamentals- experiment with precedence and selectors
* Css-grids-frameworks- implement a bootstrap grid and styles
* Css-responsive- learn to add in styles for different screen sizes and dynamically change elements with these screen sizes
